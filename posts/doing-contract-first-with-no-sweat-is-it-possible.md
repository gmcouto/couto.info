### What is contract-first anyway?

### Is it really doable?

Whenever I heard someone saying that they wanted to start building services using contract-first approach I used to frown on them. Why? It seemed kind of pointless to create all that contract ahead, and see it changes during development.

The documentation, tests, end everything would be required to be updated whenever a change is needed. I don't know about your team, but here we deal with a lot of changes. So I always looked at this approach as it was "great in theory, but in practice....".

Recently I found there is a pragmatical way to apply this technique, and there are a lot of tools that help keeping everything updated from a "single source of truth", while enabling to execute good practices, like "TDD" and "BDD" for integration tests, with no sweat.

Today we will learn how we can leverage the openapi-first approach into the development cycle.

### OpenAPI Specification

You probably have heard of Swagger at least once, right? They were the ones that kind of standardized a way to write api first, and generate code later. Eventually they open-sourced this standard, and called it ["OpenAPI Specification"](https://swagger.io/specification/ "OpenAPI Specification Website"). It is just a way to describe RESTful webservices.

What do I mean? It's easier to show:

    openapi: 3.0.2
    info:
      title: Sample API
      contact:
        name: Gabriel Couto
      version: 1.0.0
    
    paths:
    /uppercase:
        post:
          summary: Make any string uppercase
          operationId: postToUppercase
          requestBody:
            description: "A message"
            required: true
            content:
              text/plain;charset=utf-8:
                schema:
                  type: string
                  minLength: 1
                  example: "some message to convert"
          responses:
            '200':
              description: "OK"
              content:
                text/plain;charset=utf-8:
                  schema:
                    type: string
                    example: "SOME MESSAGE TO CONVERT"
            '400':
              description: "Bad Request"

This is the simplest example I can think of: it is a path named `/uppercase`, and when you POST a string to this endpoint, it will return the same string in uppercase. Of course, using this specification you can describe way more complex services, with their object model specification, authentication schemes, etc.

**How will this help you?** By using _code generators_.

### OpenAPI Generator

One of the greatest works that has been done over OpenAPI specification, is the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/ "OpenAPI Generator"). It is a tool, that you plug-in into your Maven, Gradle, or whatever build tool, or even whatever language you have... that will create all the code for this RESTful web-service, for except the implementation.

But you can count on controllers, paths, models, validators and documentation... everything available for the generator you are using (some languages may vary the amount of work the generator does, but you can contribute to improve it). In this example, I'll be showing you the Maven plugin, that integrates the OpenAPI specification, into your java project, using Spring as the controller, and Swagger as documentation.

### Conclusion

As you can see, we can use openapi and these tools to greatly improve how we design RESTful web-services. Not only that, you will get your models, controllers, validators and Swagger documentation always 100% up-to-date for free... I mean almost: It takes some adjusting to the development flow that you will always have to design your API first for all the changes, before applying code.

It is not actually necessary to follow the "contract-first development cycle", because nothing will hold your back and keep you from changing the controllers and creating your own models by yourself... but it will be nice to have your API always reflect the source of truth.

##### Note

The code I showed you here is part of a [proof of concept project](https://github.com/gmcouto/apifirst-tdd-with-karate "API First - TDD for integration tests - On cloud microservice architecture") I have on Github, that uses this and many more cool stuff. **Soon**, I'll be posting the next steps: how to use TDD for the integration tests, and how to write them using BDD.
